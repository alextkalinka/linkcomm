    structure in networks, and uncover the key nodes that form connections
    to multiple communities. linkcomm provides a set of tools for
    generating, visualizing, and analysing link communities in networks of
    arbitrary size and type. The linkcomm package also includes tools for
    generating, visualizing, and analysing Overlapping Cluster Generator
    (OCG) communities.
